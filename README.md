# Omdena Milan Challenge - Task-1: Urban Agriculture in Milan, Italy
## Task-1: Identifying Potential Areas for Urban Agriculture in Milan, Italy
### Challenge Background
Urban farming plays a crucial role in the fight against climate change by supporting sustainable food production within cities. As urbanization continues to expand, integrating agriculture into urban areas not only strengthens local food security but also reduces transportation emissions and the carbon footprint associated with conventional farming practices.

Additionally, urban farming contributes to the creation of green spaces, helps mitigate the urban heat island effect, and improves air quality. By connecting communities with locally grown food, it encourages environmental responsibility and raises awareness about the impact of traditional agriculture on climate change. Embracing urban farming is essential for the development of environmentally friendly and resilient cities, while also fostering a sustainable future in the face of global climate challenges.
### The Problem
Climate change and sustainable food production within cities.
### Task-1 Overview: Selection of optimal locations for urban farming
